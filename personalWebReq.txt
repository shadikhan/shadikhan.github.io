Going to need link to my resume; link to github. 
Projects? Maybe a nice depiction of what I do in my classes. 
A little about me would be nice, as well as my intentions of what I want to do. 
Need to pick a nice color pallette. 


I'm a second year student at the University of Maryland-College Park. I'm a Computer Science major, and will graduate Fall 2019.
